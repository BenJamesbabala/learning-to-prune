What do rollouts buy us?

This script runs rollouts at the final policy (judge by early stopping) to show
that the crude labeling that our baseline method is based on is often incorrect
or too crude.

TODO: Write up how to run these jobs and do the analysis.

Running experiment

 - Need the result of froniter script (there are two of those,
   e.g. tmp/lols10-big.csv and tmp/lols10-medium.csv)

 - Pass each of the csv files into run_job.py also run with the --baseline
   option.
